# Problem Description

Resturent App: The god of this software is th create a digitised menu that the consumer can quickly traverse, and the selected goods can be put to a wishlist.
The following is the brief:

Create an app for a restaurant that can display the business's menu to customers.
The menu should emphasise the following items:
- Should duplicate the offline menu viewing experience for customers
- The emphasis should be on the ability to readily view the menu rather than ordering from the menu
- Customers should, however, be able to mark menu items so that they can simply notify the waiter which products to order when the waiter arrives in the shortest amount of time.


Must Have :
1. Display the list of all the Menu Items of the day.  
2. Show your invoices 
3. Add a new invoice.
4. Show categories (including food, water bills, etc.)
5. Order Management and Wait Time
6. Feedback and tip
